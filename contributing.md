- The body of your commit message should contain a defense for the Tech Level you choose.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, I might ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.

### Thanks to the original [Awesome List](https://github.com/agarrharr/) for providing `awesome` contribution guidelines.
