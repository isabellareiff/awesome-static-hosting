## Free
- [BitBucket Pages](https://pages.bitbucket.io/) - **Tech Lvl: 3/5** - Same deal as Gihub and Gitlab Pages, but a little less documented. Unlimited free private repositories, and free for teams up to 5 users.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) - **Tech Lvl: 5/5** - Free custom domain with SSL support and setup custom hosting behavior using the Firebase CLI. Big Advantage: able to run server-side dynamic processing.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - **Tech Lvl: 3/5** The OG Github static website host. Free to host from any Github repository, and easily connect custom domains. Major Con: Private repositories (aka private website source code) only with paid monthly plan.
- [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) - **Tech Lvl: 3/5** - Very similar to Github pages, except hosted with Gitlab instead. Unlike Github Pages, you have unlimited private and public repositories, allowing your website source code to always be hidden, and it works with (almost) all static site generators, not just Jekyll.
- [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) - You can go with the built-in "in browser html editor", or drag and drop your files directly into your website.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - **Tech Lvl: 3/5** - Awesome alternative to Github Pages - choose Github, GitLab, or BitBucket to host your repository, and then publish unlimited repositories for free with Netlify. Offers automatic form handling, SSL for custom domains, works automatically with ALL static site generators, and 1-click rollbacks to previous versions of your website, without using branches.
- [Updog](https://updog.co/) - **Tech Lvl: 1/5** - Publish with Dropbox or Google Drive, the free plan includes one website and support for a custom domain name, custom 404 page, and custom favicons.

## Super Cheap
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/services-costs/) - **Tech Lvl: 5/5** - Amazon Web Services offers a free usage tier for hosting static websites, and if you stay within it your monthly cost can come out to <$1.00. AWS Scales easily and is very robust, but can be difficult for less "techy" people.
- [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/) - **Tech Lvl: 2/5** - Made as a dumbed-down version of Netlify, simply drag and drop your html, CSS, and JS files into BitBalloon, and it compiles them into a website with automatic form handling. Free on a .bitballoon.com URL, $5/month on a custom URL.
- [Forge](https://getforge.com/) - **Tech Lvl: 2/5** - Version based history, ability to collaborate, host files from Github, Dropbox, or Drag & Drop a .zip folder. Forge is really simple and has little to no learning curve for the inexperienced user.
- [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) - **Tech Lvl: 3/5** - A little more robust than a classic static site generator, as they handle PHP and SQL, but still host static sites at extremely low prices, and easily handle custom domains.

## Paid
- [Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com) -  **Tech Lvl: 3/5** - A static site host with mandatory wildcard SSL, 500 GB/Month data transfer, and is extremely easy to get started with Jekyll, Hugo, React, Yeoman, Hexo, and, of course, plain HTML.
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) - **Tech Lvl: 5/5** - Set up and deploy your own linux virtual server. For people who know pretty much exactly what they're doing, what they want to do, and how they want to do it.
