## Free
- [Github Pages](hithere)
- [Updog](https://updog.co/) - Publish with Dropbox or Google Drive, the free plan includes one website and support for a custom domain name, custom 404 page, and custom favicons. There are simple video tutorials to help you get your website up, and there is basically no learning curve, assuming you understand html and CSS. There is a $3/month plan for those who want unlimited websites.
- [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) - You can go with the built-in "in browser html editor", or drag and drop your files directly into your website.
- [Gitlab Pages](hithere)
- [hello](hithere)

- [hello](hithere)

## Paid Very Little
- [Forge](https://getforge.com/) - Version based history, ability to collaborate, host files from Github, Dropbox, or Drag & Drop a .zip folder. Forge is really simple and has little to no learning curve for the inexperienced user.
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/services-costs/) - Amazon Web Services offers a free usage tier for hosting static websites, and if you stay within it your monthly cost can come out to <$1.00. AWS Scales easily and is very robust, but can be difficult for less "techy" people.
- [hello](hithere)
- [hello](hithere)
- [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) - A little different, they allow for PHP, but still host static sites at extremely low prices, and easily handle custom domains.


## Paid More
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) - Set up and deploy your own linux virtual server. For people who know pretty much exactly what they're doing, what they want to do, and how they want to do it.
