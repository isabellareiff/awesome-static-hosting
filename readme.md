## Free
- [BitBucket Pages](https://pages.bitbucket.io/) - Same deal as Gihub and Gitlab Pages, but a little less documented. Unlimited free private repositories, and free for teams up to 5 users.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - The OG Github static website host. Free to host from any Github repository, and easily connect custom domains. Major Con: Private repositories (aka private website source code) only with paid monthly plan.
- [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) - Very similar to Github pages, except hosted with Gitlab instead. Unlike Github Pages, you have unlimited private and public repositories, allowing your website source code to always be hidden, and it works with (almost) all static site generators, not just Jekyll.
- [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) - You can go with the built-in "in browser html editor", or drag and drop your files directly into your website.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Awesome alternative to Github Pages - choose Github, GitLab, or BitBucket to host your repository, and then publish unlimited repositories for free with Netlify. Offers automatic form handling, SSL for custom domains, works automatically with ALL static site generators, and 1-click rollbacks to previous versions of your website, without using branches.
- [Updog](https://updog.co/) - Publish with Dropbox or Google Drive, the free plan includes one website and support for a custom domain name, custom 404 page, and custom favicons.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) - Free custom domain with SSL support and setup custom hosting behavior using the Firebase CLI. Big Advantage: able to run server-side dynamic processing. Tech Know-How Needed: 8.

## Super Cheap
- [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/) - Made as a dumbed-down version of Netlify, simply drag and drop your html, CSS, and JS files into BitBalloon, and it compiles them into a website with automatic form handling. Free on a .bitballoon.com URL, $5/month on a custom URL.
- [Forge](https://getforge.com/) - Version based history, ability to collaborate, host files from Github, Dropbox, or Drag & Drop a .zip folder. Forge is really simple and has little to no learning curve for the inexperienced user.
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/services-costs/) - Amazon Web Services offers a free usage tier for hosting static websites, and if you stay within it your monthly cost can come out to <$1.00. AWS Scales easily and is very robust, but can be difficult for less "techy" people.
- [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) - A little different, they allow for PHP, but still host static sites at extremely low prices, and easily handle custom domains.


## Paid
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) - Set up and deploy your own linux virtual server. For people who know pretty much exactly what they're doing, what they want to do, and how they want to do it.
- [Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com) - A static site host with mandatory wildcard SSL, 500 GB/Month data transfer, and is extremely easy to get started with Jekyll, Hugo, React, Yeoman, Hexo, and, of course, plain HTML.
