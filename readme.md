## Free
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - The OG Github static website host. Free to host from any Github repository, and easily connect custom domains. Major Con: Private repositories (aka private website source code) only with paid monthly plan.
- [Updog](https://updog.co/) - Publish with Dropbox or Google Drive, the free plan includes one website and support for a custom domain name, custom 404 page, and custom favicons.
- [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) - You can go with the built-in "in browser html editor", or drag and drop your files directly into your website.
- [Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) - Very similar to Github pages, except hosted with Gitlab instead. Unlike Github Pages, you have unlimited private and public repositories, allowing your website source code to always be hidden, and it works with (almost) all static site generators, not just Jekyll.
- [BitBucket Pages](https://pages.bitbucket.io/) - 
- [Netlify](hithere)
- [BitBalloon](hithere)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/)

## Super Cheap
- [Forge](https://getforge.com/) - Version based history, ability to collaborate, host files from Github, Dropbox, or Drag & Drop a .zip folder. Forge is really simple and has little to no learning curve for the inexperienced user.
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/services-costs/) - Amazon Web Services offers a free usage tier for hosting static websites, and if you stay within it your monthly cost can come out to <$1.00. AWS Scales easily and is very robust, but can be difficult for less "techy" people.

- [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) - A little different, they allow for PHP, but still host static sites at extremely low prices, and easily handle custom domains.


## Paid
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) - Set up and deploy your own linux virtual server. For people who know pretty much exactly what they're doing, what they want to do, and how they want to do it.
- [Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com) - A static site host with mandatory wildcard SSL, 500 GB/Month data transfer, and is extremely easy to get started with Jekyll, Hugo, React, Yeoman, Hexo, and, of course, plain HTML.
